# Base-5-Calculator
Project work for EEE 4308 (Digital Electronics Lab)

This repository contains all Proteus simluation and PCB design files for a base-5 number system calculator with fully implemented Adder, Subtractor, Multiplier, Divider and Memory Unit. Each unit has its own subcircuit within the main simulation file as well as its own PCB design. Hardware implementation was also done and images are available.

This team-based project was necessary for the completion of the 1.5 credit lab course, Digital Electronics Lab.
